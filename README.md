## Instructions

A general description of the BigLab 2 is avaible in the `course-materials` repository, [under _labs_](https://polito-wa1-aw1-2022.github.io/materials/labs/BigLab2/BigLab2.pdf). In the same repository, you can find the [instructions for GitHub Classroom](https://polito-wa1-aw1-2022.github.io/materials/labs/GH-Classroom-BigLab-Instructions.pdf), covering BigLabs and exam sessions.

Once you cloned this repository, please write the group name and names of the members of the group in the above section.

In the `client` directory, do **NOT** create a new folder for the project, i.e., `client` should directly contain the `public` and `src` folders and the `package.json` files coming from BigLab1.

When committing on this repository, please, do **NOT** commit the `node_modules` directory, so that it is not pushed to GitHub.
This should be already automatically excluded from the `.gitignore` file, but double-check.

When another member of the team pulls the updated project from the repository, remember to run `npm install` in the project directory to recreate all the Node.js dependencies locally, in the `node_modules` folder.
Remember that `npm install` should be executed inside the `client` and `server` folders (not in the `BigLab2` root directory).

Finally, remember to add the `final` tag for the final submission, otherwise it will not be graded.

## Registered Users

Here you can find a list of the users already registered inside the provided database. This information will be used during the fourth week, when you will have to deal with authentication.
If you decide to add additional users, please remember to add them to this table (with **plain-text password**)!

| email | password | name |
|-------|----------|------|
| john.doe@polito.it | password | John |
| mario.rossi@polito.it | password | Mario |
